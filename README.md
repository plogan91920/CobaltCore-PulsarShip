# CobaltCore-PulsarShip

This is a ship mod for Cobalt Core!

## Description
This mod adds a new ship for Cobalt Core: The Pulsar!
The Pulsar is a ship with an artificial star as it's power source. The ebb and flow of the rotating pulsar converts energy into shields at the end of your turn and shields into energy at the start!
In order to set up the potential power spikes this can create the ship has 1 fewer base energy but draws 1 more card, which can make early game more difficult.
